</h1>

<p align='center'>
  This is a guide on how to create gifs of your project using <a href='https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture'>Giphy</a> and then use it on your github readme.
</p>

  Mainly for Mac users - none of this was test on other OS
</p>

## 1. Getting started
<p>First things first, you need to download <a href='https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture'>Giphy!</a></p>

</p>

<div>This is what we will be using to create gifs to use</div>

## 2. Creating Gifs!
<p>Once you've got Giphy up an running, you'll see a green screen that you can adjust to the size of your project.</p>
<p>After adjusting to your project, just hit record!</p>

  <img src='https://github.com/stevkim/how-to-gif/blob/main/assets/pictures/long.png' width='48%' height='300'/>
</p>

- General rule of thumb is to keep your gifs less than 10 seconds long.

<p>After you're done recording, you can trim the gif! See above for some quick notes on this.</p>
<p>Now save it to your project folder! - I like to create a folder called gifs in my root folder. </p>
<p>Once its saved, dont forget to push it to Github!</p>

</p>

## 3. Adding it to Readme
<p>To add your newly created gif to your read me, you just need to get the gif link address and plug it into an img tag!</p>

```
  <img src='linktoyourgif' />
```
<p align='center'>
  <img src='https://github.com/stevkim/how-to-gif/blob/main/assets/gifs/link.gif' width='70%' />
</p>

Then you're done! You now have a gif for your amazing project to show off!
